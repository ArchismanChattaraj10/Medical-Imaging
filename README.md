# Introduction
Image segmentation and object detection are two crucial tasks in the field of computer vision 
that play a significant role in understanding and analysing images and videos. These techniques 
enable machines to comprehend the visual content of digital media, replicating the human 
ability to perceive objects and their boundaries within an image.
Image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning an image into multiple meaningful and 
semantically coherent regions. The goal is to identify and separate different objects or regions 
of interest within an image based on their visual characteristics such as colour, texture, or shape. 
By segmenting an image, we can precisely locate and delineate individual objects, allowing for 
a deeper understanding and analysis of the image's content. 
 
On the other hand, object detection goes beyond image segmentation by not only identifying 
and localising objects within an image but also classifying them into specific categories. The 
primary objective is to detect and recognize multiple instances of different objects present in 
an image while accurately predicting their bounding boxes and assigning corresponding class 
labels. 
Object detection enables various practical applications such as autonomous driving, 
surveillance systems, and augmented reality, among others. Both image segmentation and 
object detection are key building blocks for advanced computer vision tasks. They form the 
foundation for applications like semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object 
tracking. These techniques have seen tremendous advancements with the advent of deep 
learning and convolutional neural networks, which have revolutionised the field of computer 
vision by achieving remarkable accuracy and performance on various datasets. 
In conclusion, image segmentation and object detection are vital computer vision techniques 
that enable machines to understand, interpret, and interact with visual data. They have broad 
implications across diverse domains, driving advancements in fields such as robotics, 
healthcare, retail, drug development and many more.
